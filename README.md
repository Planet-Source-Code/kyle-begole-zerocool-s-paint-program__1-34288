## ^^^ZeroCool's Paint Program^^^


</div>

### Description

This is a simple, yet more advanced version of the Microsoft Paint Program that is included within the Windows bundle. As of right now there are a few things that aren't exactly working but, you will get the jist of it. I soon hope to have a few more "normal" paint features on here. Above all else, have fun, and if you can help is always nice.
 
### More Info
 
There are no comments. Bad programming style, yes. But at this moment I haven't had time. So, by the next version I hope there will be some comments and possibly help. I'm available through email to help at anytime~~Adidas1071323@aol.com
